# fightCancer_app_streamlit

An interactive **Streamlit application** designed to assess the risk of developing cancer based on personal health data and lifestyle habits.

The model uses a **Random Forest classifier** trained with **SMOTE resampling** to correct class imbalance.

---

## Features

- Interactive input of personal and lifestyle information  
- Risk score prediction using a pre-trained machine learning model  
- Risk displayed as a percentage (0%: low risk → 100%: very high risk)  
- Personalized health advice based on the predicted score  
- Clear, user-friendly results interface

## Dataset
This application is based on the **HINTS 7 (2024)** (Health Information National Trends Survey) dataset, containing **77 questions** and conducted by the **National Cancer Institute (NCI)** in the United States.

- **Data collection period**: March – September 2024
- **Modes**: paper and web, with financial incentives ($2 + $10)
- **Sampling method**: 2-stage random sampling (address + one adult per household)
- **Goal**: to assess health behaviors, lifestyle, and access to medical information among U.S. adults
- **Built-in experiments**:
  - *Commitment to answer truthfully* to improve data quality
  - Additional $10 incentive in high-minority strata to improve representation
- **Official source**: https://hints.cancer.gov
- **License**: public data available for research and non-commercial use

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The prediction algorithm is based on a **Random Forest Classifier**, selected after automated comparison of several models using the **PyCaret** library.

---

## Modeling Process

- **Preprocessing:**
  - Data cleaning from the HINTS 7 survey
  - Encoding of categorical variables
  - Class balancing using **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

- **Model comparison:**
  - Automated benchmarking via **PyCaret** with models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, etc.
  - Evaluation metrics: **Accuracy**, **Recall**, **F1-score**, **AUC**, **MCC**

- **Final selection:**
  - **Random Forest** was chosen for its balance of **performance**, **robustness**, and **interpretability**
  - **Recall on the “high-risk” class** was prioritized due to the health-critical nature of the task

### 📈 Random Forest Model Results

| Class             | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Support |
|-------------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| 0 (low risk)      | 0.73      | 0.66   | 0.69     | 91      |
| 1 (high risk)     | 0.68      | 0.75   | 0.71     | 87      |
| **Overall Accuracy** |         |        | **0.70** | 178     |

The model **maximizes recall for the "high-risk" class (0.75)** to avoid missing potentially serious cases.

- The trained model was saved and integrated into the app using `joblib`.

## Training Pipeline

**Main steps:**

- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Categorical variable encoding  
- Normalization (if needed)  
- Application of **SMOTE** to balance the low-risk / high-risk classes  
- Model training with Random Forest  
- Export of the trained model with `joblib` for app integration
